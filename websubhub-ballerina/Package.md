## Module Overview

This module contains an implementation of the W3C [**WebSub**](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/) recommendation, which facilitates a push-based content delivery/notification mechanism between publishers and subscribers.

This implementation supports introducing following WebSub components:
 
- Publisher - A party that advertises topics to which interested parties subscribe in order to receive notifications
 on occurrence of events.
- Hub - A party that accepts subscription requests from subscribers and delivers content to the subscribers when the topic 
is updated by the topic's publisher.

### Basic flow with WebSub
1. The subscriber discovers from the publisher, the topic it needs to subscribe to and the hub(s) that deliver notifications on updates of the topic.

2. The subscriber sends a subscription request to one or more discovered hub(s) specifying the discovered topic along 
 with other subscription parameters such as:
    - The callback URL to which content is expected to be delivered.
    - (Optional) The lease period (in seconds) the subscriber wants the subscription to stay active.
    - (Optional) A secret to use for [authenticated content distribution](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#signing-content).
  
3. The hub sends an intent verification request to the specified callback URL. If the response indicates 
verification
 (by echoing a challenge specified in the request) by the subscriber, the subscription is added for the topic at the 
 hub.
   
4. The publisher notifies the hub of updates to the topic and the content to deliver is identified.

5. The hub delivers the identified content to the subscribers of the topic.

### Features

#### Hub

A WebSub compliant hub based on the Ballerina Message Broker is also available. This can be used as a remote hub or to be used by publishers who want to have their own internal hub. Ballerina's WebSub hub honors specified lease periods and supports authenticated content distribution.

##### Enabling Basic Auth support for the hub

The Ballerina WebSub Hub can be secured by enforcing authentication (Basic Authentication) and (optionally) authorization. 
The `AuthProvider` and `authConfig` need to be specified for the hub listener and service respectively. If the 
`authStoreProvider` of the `AuthProvider` is set as "http:CONFIG_AUTH_STORE", usernames and passwords for authentication and scopes for authorization would be read from a config TOML file.
A user can specify `AuthProvider` as follows and set it to the `hubListenerConfig` record, which is passed when starting the hub.

```ballerina
http:BasicAuthHandler basicAuthHandler = new(new auth:InboundBasicAuthProvider());

http:ServiceEndpointConfiguration hubListenerConfig = {
    auth: {
        authHandlers: [basicAuthHandler]
    },
    secureSocket: {
        keyStore: {
            path: config:getAsString("b7a.home") + "bre/security/ballerinaKeystore.p12",
            password: "ballerina"
        }
    }
};

var val = websub:startHub(new http:Listener(9191, hubListenerConfig));
```
In addition to the `BasicAuthHandler` for the listener, a user also has to specify the `authConfig` properties at the service or resource levels. 

 
They can be set by passing arguments for the `serviceAuth`, `subscriptionResourceAuth` or `publisherResourceAuth` parameters when starting up the hub.

Recognized users can be specified in a `.toml` file, which can be passed as a configuration file when running the program. 

```
[b7a.users]

[b7a.users.tom]
password="1234"
scopes="scope1"
```

Once the hub is secured using basic auth, a subscriber should provide the relevant `auth` config in the 
`hubClientConfig` field of the subscriber service annotation.

```ballerina
auth:OutboundBasicAuthProvider basicAuthProvider = new({
    username: "tom",
    password: "1234"
});

http:BasicAuthHandler basicAuthHandler = new(basicAuthProvider);

@websub:SubscriberServiceConfig {
    path: "/ordereventsubscriber",
    hubClientConfig: {
        auth: {
            authHandler: basicAuthHandler
        }
    }
}
```

##### Enabling data persistence for the hub

The Ballerina WebSub Hub supports persistence of topic and subscription data that needs to be restored when the hub is 
restarted.
 
Users can introduce their own persistence implementation, by introducing an object type that is structurally 
equivalent to the `websub:HubPersistenceStore` abstract object.

Persistence can be enabled by setting a suitable `websub:HubPersistenceStore` value for the `hubPersistenceStore` field 
in the `HubConfiguration` record, which is passed to the `websub:startHub()` function.

Any subscriptions added at the hub will be available even after the hub is restarted.

#### Publisher

Ballerina WebSub publishers can use utility functions to add WebSub link headers indicating the hub and topic 
URLs, which facilitates WebSub discovery.

A hub client endpoint is also made available to publishers and subscribers to perform the following:
- Publishers
  - Register a topic at the Hub
    ```ballerina
    websub:PublisherClient websubHubClientEP = new ("http://localhost:9191/websub/publish");
    error? registrationResponse = websubHubClientEP->registerTopic("http://websubpubtopic.com");
    ```
    
  - Publish to the hub indicating an update of the topic
    ```ballerina
    websub:PublisherClient websubHubClientEP = new ("http://localhost:9191/websub/publish");
    error? publishResponse = websubHubClientEP.publishUpdate("http://websubpubtopic.com",
                                {"action": "publish", "mode": "internal-hub"});   
    ```
    
- Subscribers
  - Subscribe/Unsubscribe to/from topics at a hub
    
    ```ballerina
    websub:SubscriptionClient websubHubClientEP = new("<HUB_URL>");
    
    // Send subscription request for a subscriber service.
    websub:SubscriptionChangeRequest subscriptionRequest = {
        topic: "<TOPIC_URL>", 
        callback: "<CALLBACK_URL>",
        secret: "<SECRET>"
    };
    websub:SubscriptionChangeResponse|error subscriptionChangeResponse = websubHubClientEP->subscribe(subscriptionRequest);
    
    // Send unsubscription request for the subscriber service.
    websub:SubscriptionChangeRequest unsubscriptionRequest = {
        topic: "<TOPIC_URL>",
        callback: "<CALLBACK_URL>"
    };
    websub:SubscriptionChangeResponse|error subscriptionChangeResponse = websubHubClientEP->unsubscribe(unsubscriptionRequest);
    ```
